## AI review scope

GLM review defaults to **hybrid**: the first review is full, then follow-ups
review changes since the last completed review plus a rotating sample of older
PR changes. Keep hybrid for normal implementation/fix cycles.

Before the next review-triggering push, apply at most one override label:

- `zai-review:full` for high-risk changes, force-push recovery, or a deliberate
  final deep audit.
- `zai-review:hybrid` to explicitly select the normal delta-plus-audit mode.
- `zai-review:incremental` only for low-risk, latency-sensitive follow-ups
  after a completed full review; this omits the rotating old-code audit.

Labels select the next run but do not trigger one themselves. Remove an override
to return to hybrid. Missing/incomplete state and non-ancestor history safely
fall back to a full review.
